# RHACS declarative configuration

This repo serves as a demo for the declarative configuration feature for RHACS.

It's currently used in combination with [the roxctl CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/acs/cli/getting-started-cli.html) and [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a sample GitOps workflow.
